EVgo Coding test Project

Steps to Install the project
1. Clone the project to your local machine from the Git repository (Do not rename the project to avoid any unexpected build issues)
2. Go to the project root folder from the Terminal
3. Run the command "npm install" (This will install all the node packages required)
4. Go into the iOS folder by running the command "cd ios"
5. Run the command "pod install" (This will install all the pod dependencies for running the iOS project)
6. Come back to the project root folder by running the command "cd ../"
7. Make sure iOS simulator is running
8. Run the command "react-native run-ios"

Grab a coffee as the first time run takes couple of minutes to build and launch the app on the simulator.
